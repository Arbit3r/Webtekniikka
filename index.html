			<p>Academic research related to deepfakes lies predominantly within the field of computer vision, a subfield of computer science.[12] An early landmark project was the Video Rewrite program, published in 1997, which modified existing video footage of a person speaking to depict that person mouthing the words contained in a different audio track.[15] It was the first system to fully automate this kind of facial reanimation, and it did so using machine learning techniques to make connections between the sounds produced by a video's subject and the shape of the subject's face.[15]

			Contemporary academic projects have focused on creating more realistic videos and on improving techniques.[16][17] The "Synthesizing Obama" program, published in 2017, modifies video footage of former president Barack Obama to depict him mouthing the words contained in a separate audio track.[16] The project lists as a main research contribution its photorealistic technique for synthesizing mouth shapes from audio.[16] The Face2Face program, published in 2016, modifies video footage of a person's face to depict them mimicking the facial expressions of another person in real time.[17] The project lists as a main research contribution the first method for re-enacting facial expressions in real time using a camera that does not capture depth, making it possible for the technique to be performed using common consumer cameras.[17]

			In August 2018, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published a paper introducing a fake dancing app that can create the impression of masterful dancing ability using AI.[18][19] This project expands the application of deepfakes to the entire body; previous works focused on the head or parts of the face.[18]</p>
